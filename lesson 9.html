                    <p><strong>Before</strong> John went to the cinema last night, he had already watched the trailer for the new action movie. He was excited because he had heard so much about it. His friends had told him that it was one of the best movies of the year, and they had recommended he see it.</p>
            
                    <p>When he arrived at the theater, he realized he had forgotten to bring his wallet. Fortunately, his friend Emma had already bought the tickets, so they could still go inside. While waiting for the movie to start, they talked about the books they had been reading. John mentioned that he had finished a great mystery novel last week, which he had borrowed from the library. Emma had read a science fiction book earlier this year, and she said it was fascinating.</p>
            
                    <p>After the movie, they went to a nearby café. John said that the movie had been amazing, but he thought the ending could have been better. Emma agreed, adding that the movie had not lived up to the expectations set by the reviews. Both of them agreed that they had enjoyed the music in the movie, though. The soundtrack was one of the best parts.</p>
            
                    <p>John asked Emma if she had seen the new musical that was playing in town. Emma replied that she had not seen it yet, but she had heard that it was fantastic. She had always enjoyed musicals, especially when they had good songs. They talked for a while about their favorite performances and how they had seen many live concerts in the past.</p>
