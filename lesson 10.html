                <div class="explanation">
                    <h2>What is the Present Perfect Continuous Tense?</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>Present Perfect Continuous</strong> tense is used to express actions that started in the past and are still continuing in the present, or actions that were recently completed but are still relevant in the present moment. It emphasizes the duration of the action.</p>
            
                    <h3>Structure of Present Perfect Continuous:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Affirmative (Positive) form:</strong> Subject + has/have + been + verb (-ing)  
                            <br>Example: "She has been working for three hours."</li>
                        <li><strong>Negative form:</strong> Subject + has/have + not + been + verb (-ing)  
                            <br>Example: "He hasn't been studying much lately."</li>
                        <li><strong>Question form:</strong> Has/Have + subject + been + verb (-ing)?  
                            <br>Example: "Have you been reading this book?"</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3>When is the Present Perfect Continuous Used?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>For actions that started in the past and continue into the present:</strong>  
                            Example: "She has been working here for five years."</li>
                        <li><strong>For actions that were completed recently but are important in the present:</strong>  
                            Example: "I’ve been looking for my keys all morning!"</li>
                        <li><strong>To emphasize the duration of an activity:</strong>  
                            Example: "They have been playing football for two hours."</li>
                        <li><strong>For temporary or repeated actions:</strong>  
                            Example: "She has been practicing yoga every day this week."</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3>Key Features of Present Perfect Continuous:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Duration of action:</strong> Focus on how long an activity has been happening.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unspecified time:</strong> The exact starting point of the action is not important.</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3>Examples:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"They have been working hard all day."</li>
                        <li>"I have been trying to call you for hours."</li>
                        <li>"We have been waiting for you since 5 o’clock."</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h3>Important Time Expressions:</h3>
                    <p>Present Perfect Continuous is often used with time expressions such as <strong>for</strong>, <strong>since</strong>, <strong>all day</strong>, <strong>lately</strong>, and <strong>recently</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: "I have been learning English for two years." (The action started in the past and continues to the present.)</li>
                    </ul>
